Up to today, there are 3 libraries located in the rural areas of this region. One place does not even have access to a phone network line and another one does not have access to internet connection. Only one has access to both networks but very unstable. These libraries are called Spring Library as these were established during the Spring Revolution of Burma. You can check the activities of these libraries also on Facebook.</p>
