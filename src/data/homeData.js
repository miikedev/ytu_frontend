            "description": "For four generations from BIT of colonial age to YTU of democracy age, YTU has been the premiere university of engineering in Myanmar. Located in Insein, the university boasts a large campus with the country's best facilities. After years of closing undergraduate programs as a result of the nation wide 8888 uprisings, YTU finally reopened its undergraduate programs in 2012. Since then, YTU offers 14 undergraduate engineering and architecture programs, a range of post graduate and doctorate programs.\n\n            Due to ongoing Spring Revolution, the physical campus is temporarily closed and the education services can be acquired only from online via university official website (insert link). The teachers and students are also joining Civil Disobedience Movement and also participating in various sectors of revolution.",
